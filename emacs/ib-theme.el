;; IBM-inspired themes for GNU Emacs based on IBM Carbon Design System.
;; This package provides both dark and light variants of the iB-theme.
;;
;; The themes implement the IBM Carbon Design System color palette,
;; offering excellent readability and a professional appearance
;; suitable for extended coding sessions.
;;
;; Available themes:
;; - ib-theme-dark: Dark variant with high contrast
;; - ib-theme-light: Light variant with excellent readability
;;
;; To use these themes, add one of the following to your init file:
;;   (load-theme 'ib-theme-dark t)
;;   (load-theme 'ib-theme-light t)
;;
;; Or use M-x customize-themes to select them interactively.
;;
;; The themes support a wide range of packages including:
;; - Org mode
;; - Magit
;; - Company
;; - Flycheck
;; - Helm
;; - Ivy
;; - Which-key
;; - Rainbow delimiters
;; - Web mode
